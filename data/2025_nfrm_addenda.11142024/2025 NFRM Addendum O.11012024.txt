"NOTE:  As discussed in sections III.A. (Proposed OPPS Treatment of New and Revised HCPCS Codes) and XIII.B (Proposed ASC Treatment of New and Revised Codes) of the CY 2025 OPPS/ASC proposed rule, we requested comments on new CPT codes that would be effective January 1, 2025, which are listed below. Specifically, we requested comments on the OPPS status indicator and APC assignments, as well as the ASC payment indicator assignments for the codes assigned to comment indicator ""NP"" (New code for the next calendar year or existing code with substantial revision to its code descriptor in the next calendar year as compared to current calendar year, proposed APC assignment; comments will be accepted on the proposed APC assignment for the new code.). We note that because the CPT code descriptors that appeared in Addendum B are short descriptors and do not accurately describe the complete procedure, service, or item described by the CPT code, we included the 5-digit placeholder codes and their long descriptors for the new and revised CY 2025 CPT codes in Addendum O to the proposed rule so that the public could adequately comment on our proposed APCs and status indicator assignments. Listed below in column A are the final CY 2025 CPT codes for the placeholder codes. The final CY 2025 payment rates for these codes can be found in OPPS Addendum B, ASC Addendum AA, and ASC Addendum BB of the CY 2025 OPPS/ASC final rule with comment period, which are available via the internet on the CMS website."
